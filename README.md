# IIT-M: Business Data Management
# JK Clothing - BDM Capstone Project
This repository contains the code and reports for my BDM Capstone Project, focused on optimizing revenue streams and operational efficiency for JK Clothing, a garment manufacturer and exporter in Jaipur, India.

## Project Overview:
JK Clothing faces challenges such as stagnant sales, inefficient inventory management, and a limited understanding of evolving customer preferences. This project aims to address these issues through a data-driven approach.

## Data and Methodology:

**Data**: The project utilizes four months of manufacturing and sales data (May-August 2023) from JK Clothing.

**Methodology**:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns in sales, inventory, and customer behavior.
- Predictive modeling (e.g., forecasting demand) to anticipate future trends and optimize inventory.
- Data visualization to effectively communicate findings and insights.

## Files and Folders:
- **Code**: Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, modeling, and visualization (Google Colab Notebooks).
- **Reports**: Project proposal, Mid-term, and Final report summarizing findings, recommendations, and conclusions.

## Project Outcomes:
- **Expand online presence**: Use e-commerce platforms to reach a wider audience and reduce reliance on seasonal tourism.
- **Optimize inventory**: Implement a flexible production strategy aligned with seasonal demand and improve sales forecasting.
- **Enhance customer focus**: Tailor marketing efforts based on customer preferences.
- **Improve operational efficiency**: Streamline supply chain operations to better respond to market fluctuations.

## Tools and Technologies:
